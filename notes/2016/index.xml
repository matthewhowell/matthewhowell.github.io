      <title>30</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2013/30/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is May, 10th 2013, which means that I am now thirty years old. Thanks to calendars, I saw this coming and was able to prepare myself. I even found some time over the last three decades (!) to write a few words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented as advice to my younger self, exactly thirty things that I (think I kind of) know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to give unsolicited advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showing up on time, consistently and without fanfare, is the single best way to show another person that you respect them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People should hear nice things about themselves. Do not assume that everyone does. Give more honest compliments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you drink beer, drink the absolute best beer available, even if that means you can afford fewer beers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to be the best person that you can be all the time. Maintaining different identities is a burden and it distracts you from working on your real one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kindness, and the strength to display it in all situations, is the single most admirable quality that people can possess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If given the opportunity, people will surprise you. Leaving yourself open to these surprises is a kind of risk. Taking that risk is how you believe in people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Own fewer things. Identify possessions that you love. Take care of them, treat them well, and keep them forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When with others, make every possible effort to be with them wholeheartedly and every possible effort to not fiddle with your mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every photograph and video you take at a concert or other live event will probably be terrible. Just enjoy the moments, don&amp;rsquo;t feel pressured to document them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let people leave your life when they need to. Leave a light on for them in case they ever decide to return. Collect those lights and regularly remember why you keep them lit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more letters. Literal, pen-and-paper, had-to-buy-a-stamp-and-remember-where-your-friend-lives letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a relentless champion of people you care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When hugging, hug with two arms, while standing and applying reasonable, affectionate pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take every possible precaution to ensure that you own what you make: words, art, music, photographs, and even social media updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make something that you think could help someone, give it away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to bed an hour earlier and wake up an hour earlier. Life is nicer in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give more, smaller, unexpected, personal gifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will miss things. You will not live long enough to experience everything. Try to spend time with this in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To accomplish something difficult, make the work as easy as you can on yourself. Remove every obstacle except the work. Then do the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When writing lists of advice, simply mine your past mistakes and failures, then try to rephrase them as folksy wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are not many tasks that you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing repeatedly for as long as you&amp;rsquo;re alive, carrying stuff is probably one of them. Buy a really nice bag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other people cannot always see your intentions, they can see your actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No matter how important the rush that you are in, there exists someone in a more important rush, possibly the person directly in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find something small, cheap, and easily reproducible that makes your day better. Make it a point to include it in life as often as possible. I suggest tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle into the realization that other people can be as intelligent as you. And more intelligent. And less intelligent. But, understand that you often won&amp;rsquo;t be able to tell the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your parents more questions about themselves, answer more of your parents&#39; questions about yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you have finished writing a book, it&amp;rsquo;s probably best not to tell anyone that you are writing a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking comfort is just fine. Seeking unending comfort can be a trap; occasionally, pursue the uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing a ripe, soft avocado in a refrigerator will extend its life by two days, give or take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once in a while, when you feel strongly about it, break a rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Shipping is a Habit</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2013/shipping-is-a-habit/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 08:09:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2013/shipping-is-a-habit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing software is an art form. As much as it relies on engineering and science, at its heart, it is a creative pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, programming seems to be an art form that lends itself to unfinished work. We build castles in the air, but we rarely allow others to visit. We take comfort in our open projects and their obscurity. Sometimes, it can be more exciting to be working than to have worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, real artists ship and shipping is a conscious decision. Software does not ship itself. No one is going to discover your nearly-finished bug tracker 100 years after your death while buying your MacBook at a yard sale, launch it, and give you credit. Ship it while you&amp;rsquo;re alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get trapped by the idea that our work can be better. That more time and work will inevitably yield better results. Of course this is true, but it will always be true. It will never be finished, but it might already be mostly finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You guys have been working on this stuff for months now, another couple weeks isn&amp;rsquo;t going to make that much of a difference. You may as well get it over with. Just make it as good as you can.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Steve Jobs, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt&#34;&gt;Real Artists Ship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, real artists ship. This is not a new idea. What I would like to propose is that &lt;em&gt;shipping is a habit&lt;/em&gt;. Real artists are habitually shipping, they cannot stop shipping, and they understand the value of shipping. Shipping, publishing, putting-private-work-into-the-public-space frees it from the tight grasp of its creator. Art becomes real at the moment that it ships, the moment that a second person sees it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a cycle that refreshes itself. Constructive feedback, or praise, or disagreement are all seeds of creativity&amp;rsquo;s more practical cousin: iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software, like many art forms, is perpetually unfinished. Pushing it out the door is the first step in the iteration process. And iteration is the only path to great work. Second drafts are refinements of first drafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposing our efforts into public light is adicting. We start to value our public works more than our private ones, not for their notoriety, but for their temporary completeness. For the idea that they were, in some imperfect moment, finished. We ship to move our work off of the stack, to make room in our minds and our lives for new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shipping is the collision between your work and the outside world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Seth Godin, &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=dI66B5IY2X0C&amp;amp;pg=PT97&amp;amp;lpg=PT97&amp;amp;dq=godin+linchpin+%22real+artists+ship%22&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=B-nIIK7AG9&amp;amp;sig=XtKx6wpQqXPg8e0FM-0AYJGq1cQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=qmYET-2wMcXL0QG3ue3iBA&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Linchpin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, ship something today. Launch something that is useful, but isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. Publicize something that you&amp;rsquo;re only half-happy with. Show someone else a part of yourself that you aren&amp;rsquo;t particularly impressed with. The goal should be to return to that work a year later and be amused by its amateurism, for having grown. Or to return to that work tomorrow, driven to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much scarier than any result of shipping, is the idea that not shipping can become a habit too. We can be seduced by the comfort of our own minds and our own opinions of the work that we do. Our own feedback is overly accommodating, we are made partial by our own memories of how difficult it can be to create something. We can be scared to invite feedback that isn&amp;rsquo;t colored by the struggle of creation. But, while fear is a poor choice of motivator to stay put, it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic reason to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few acts more human than to make something. And when we &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2012/make-things-and-give-them-to-people/&#34;&gt;share those things with others&lt;/a&gt;, we get to grow in ways that we didn&amp;rsquo;t plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep building your castles in the air, but get in the habit of publishing the address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tins, Watches, and Emotional Assignments</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2012/tins-watches-and-emotional-assignments/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Feb 2012 08:09:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2012/tins-watches-and-emotional-assignments/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the bookcase above my desk, surrounded by a dust ring of neglect, rests an old, oval, tin box that once belonged to my great grandfather. It&amp;rsquo;s weathered with a beautiful patina that nearly obscures the detailed scenes etched into it, but just manages to make it look lived-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a single business card in that tin. The card is simple in its design, but thorough in its description of his job: &amp;ldquo;Master and Pilot for Yachts for the Atlantic Coast and Inland Waters from Maine to Florida.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a title! Sixteen words. The phone number listed on the card is a mere three digits. His first and middle name are described only in initials. Delaware is abbreviated to Del. But, that title is there fully in all of its ridiculous specificity. He must have been a proud Master and Pilot for Yachts for the Atlantic Coast and Inland Waters from Maine to Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few things that I own which carry any emotional or sentimental weight to them.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Manufactured goods are sterile in that way. So, it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to develop an affection for older items. It&amp;rsquo;s easier to believe they&amp;rsquo;ve had a life. Indifference is for things and emotions are for people. Or sometimes really, really old things that once belonged to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On occasion, I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to deliberately assign some value to those things that we choose to let surround us. By doing so, we can take an object and make it more. We can make it our own. We can give it a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I wear my Casio A168. Right now, it tells me that the time is 21:08. It lights up a stunning teal from the 1980&amp;rsquo;s and it keeps track of leap years effortlessly. It is simple, it is ugly, and you can &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GB0FXU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthowe-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000GB0FXU&#34;&gt;buy one for about 14 bucks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Etched into the back of this mass-produced work of art are some mass-produced words. CASIO. STAINLESS STEEL BACK. WATER RESISTANT. Made in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than those words will ever convey, this little thing has been perched on my wrist for some wonderful moments of my life. I saw my sister get married in this watch. It, literally, touched my nephew the very first time that I held him. It moved to New York City with me. I once fell in love wearing it. It is the subject of the most thoughtful gift that I have ever received. And as I wrote each of these words it was with me, encouraging me from my left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stretched my arm past my sleeve, letting it poke out to tell me the hour, literally, hundreds of times. It intimately knows every shirt that I own. It keeps track of any changes in the circumference of my wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a personal logo, a brand, and a mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a watch, but I have high hopes for its life. It will inevitably outlive me. I hope that it finds its way to a great, great grandchild of mine. And if it ever gets that far, I for damn sure better have etched even more memories into it.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And so, it and I keep going. We keep making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a watch. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve assigned it a larger role than that. It is a flag pole, clasped to my wrist, reminding me of the time, my age, and moments in my life that I am lucky enough to want to remember. With &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescence&#34;&gt;electroluminescence&lt;/a&gt; in case they happen at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an apartment-building-fire situation, this tin is one of a small handful of items that I would grab before tumbling down my fire escape to the safety. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I should probably provide a few decade&amp;rsquo;s worth of (currently) available batteries. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Make Things and Give Them to People</title>
      <link>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2012/make-things-and-give-them-to-people/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2012 08:09:10 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.matthewhowell.net/notes/2012/make-things-and-give-them-to-people/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2002 Kurt Vonnegut gave a speech in southern Michigan to the graduating class of Albion College. Most of what he said that day ended up being included in his memoir, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158322713X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=matthowe-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=158322713X&#34;&gt;A Man Without A Country&lt;/a&gt;, which I absolutely recommend reading. But, I&amp;rsquo;m going to pull out two phrases and one point which I think he crafted just beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indulge me and jump to about the 5:55 mark in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESwSiKRs9hc&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; and stick around for two minutes or so. He&amp;rsquo;ll start off with a joke, but it will build the context for the two quotes that I&amp;rsquo;ll pull below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people think that practicing an art is a way to make a living, is a good way to make a living. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then gives the audience a homework assignment. He asks them to write a poem, as best they can, show it to no one and then destroy it. And here&amp;rsquo;s what he expects will happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will find out, you have been rewarded, big time. This came out of you! This is the act of creativity. The hell with fame, the hell with money, you created this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking a little closer and using the VTPE&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we can come to the conclusion that Kurt was leading us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different ways that we can spend our time and I won&amp;rsquo;t be declaring that I understand life well enough to tell anyone how to spend theirs. But, I will write that I do not believe Kurt was wrong here. You will not be disappointed in spending a few minutes, or even a few hours, making something. The reward that we get, as human beings, from &lt;strong&gt;making things&lt;/strong&gt; is undeniable and universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best argument that I can grasp to support that universality is how much creating we all do as children. When unencumbered and encouraged, we were creating-machines. We colored any wax-able surface and constructed forts on anything fort-bearing. But, for so many of us, this making slows down as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a simple, two-step plan to remedy that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make things again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give them to people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step incentivizes the first. Our organic desire to create may wane over the years, but in that same time our connections to people have grown. We&amp;rsquo;ve figured out, in own ways, what friendship is, and what respect is, and what love is. And with those books on our shelves, unfinished as they may always be, we can make fantastic things.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, after making something, if you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with it (and sometimes even if you&amp;rsquo;re not), &lt;strong&gt;give it to someone&lt;/strong&gt;. Because, as human as making things is, its humanity pales next to making things for another person. Giving a gift is another, perfectly wonderful way to make your soul grow. So, here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m positing as an addendum to Kurt&amp;rsquo;s proof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s two times the soul growth for the &lt;strong&gt;maker-giver&lt;/strong&gt;. Plus, the net soul gain for the &lt;strong&gt;receiver&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write someone something, draw someone something, or sing someone something. Make anyone anything. But, sometimes, give it to them. Choose the something and the someone appropriately or inappropriately. Choose so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy, or that it&amp;rsquo;s hard, or that it&amp;rsquo;s unexpected.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You will get a reward from both the making and the giving. You will get to give a brand new part of yourself that is distinct and that was made just for another person. You will get to be reminded that you can still make new parts of yourself. All of that will be inside this &lt;strong&gt;thing that you made.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, make things and give them to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s twice the soul growth. At least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t really tried to quantify this, but it&amp;rsquo;s almost certainly positive. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnote&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s my personal favorite. &lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Ties</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was 12 years old, my father taught me to tie a four-in-hand knot. He gave me a hands-on lesson and a sheet of illustrated instructions from an old tie box. We disagreed on the ideal width of that knot, a preference which evidently increases with one&amp;rsquo;s years, but we both understood the utility of it. It was simple. And it served a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also understood that I was, from that moment on, the tier of my own ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That four-in-hand has accompanied me to interviews, to weddings, and to funerals. It&amp;rsquo;s come with me to new cities and returned with me to old towns. It&amp;rsquo;s shown up for important moments in my life and helped me show up, appropriately dressed, for important moments in the lives of people close to me. And sixteen years later, I am still recreating it, crudely, each morning before I before I go to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write software for a living in a windowless basement. The dress code for which is not formal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not found that women are unavoidably attracted to neckwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tie gets to leave my closet every weekday, and gets to ride on a train or a bicycle, to serve as a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a non-trivial amount of my time trying to improve and to update skills that I am lucky enough to be able to earn a living with. Those skills allow me to make things. They allow me to call home a city that I love. And they help me to define a curiosity which I feel grateful to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspire to that same effort in the parts of my life for which I am not paid. I want to be better in what I write, and in what I say, and in how I treat people. I have days when I am so aware of all of this that it&amp;rsquo;s thick in the air the moment that I wake up. But, I have days when it&amp;rsquo;s not. And it&amp;rsquo;s useful to build a symbol of it into my routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tie allows me to literally affix my aspirations to my neck with a knot. It is simple. And it serves a purpose. I put it on in the morning and it becomes a small, sometimes striped reminder that I am going to be a professional today, in everything that I do. And that I am on my own to tie the knot and to choose the width.&lt;/p&gt;

      <p>Today is May, 10th 2013, which means that I am now thirty years old. Thanks to calendars, I saw this coming and was able to prepare myself. I even found some time over the last three decades (!) to write a few words.</p>
<p>Presented as advice to my younger self, exactly thirty things that I (think I kind of) know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try not to give unsolicited advice.</li>
<li>Showing up on time, consistently and without fanfare, is the single best way to show another person that you respect them.</li>
<li>People should hear nice things about themselves. Do not assume that everyone does. Give more honest compliments.</li>
<li>If you drink beer, drink the absolute best beer available, even if that means you can afford fewer beers.</li>
<li>Try to be the best person that you can be all the time. Maintaining different identities is a burden and it distracts you from working on your real one.</li>
<li>Kindness, and the strength to display it in all situations, is the single most admirable quality that people can possess.</li>
<li>If given the opportunity, people will surprise you. Leaving yourself open to these surprises is a kind of risk. Taking that risk is how you believe in people.</li>
<li>Own fewer things. Identify possessions that you love. Take care of them, treat them well, and keep them forever.</li>
<li>When with others, make every possible effort to be with them wholeheartedly and every possible effort to not fiddle with your mobile devices.</li>
<li>Every photograph and video you take at a concert or other live event will probably be terrible. Just enjoy the moments, don&rsquo;t feel pressured to document them.</li>
<li>Let people leave your life when they need to. Leave a light on for them in case they ever decide to return. Collect those lights and regularly remember why you keep them lit.</li>
<li>Write more letters. Literal, pen-and-paper, had-to-buy-a-stamp-and-remember-where-your-friend-lives letters.</li>
<li>Be a relentless champion of people you care about.</li>
<li>When hugging, hug with two arms, while standing and applying reasonable, affectionate pressure.</li>
<li>Take every possible precaution to ensure that you own what you make: words, art, music, photographs, and even social media updates.</li>
<li>If you make something that you think could help someone, give it away.</li>
<li>Go to bed an hour earlier and wake up an hour earlier. Life is nicer in the morning.</li>
<li>Give more, smaller, unexpected, personal gifts.</li>
<li>You will miss things. You will not live long enough to experience everything. Try to spend time with this in mind.</li>
<li>To accomplish something difficult, make the work as easy as you can on yourself. Remove every obstacle except the work. Then do the work.</li>
<li>When writing lists of advice, simply mine your past mistakes and failures, then try to rephrase them as folksy wisdom.</li>
<li>There are not many tasks that you&rsquo;ll be doing repeatedly for as long as you&rsquo;re alive, carrying stuff is probably one of them. Buy a really nice bag.</li>
<li>Other people cannot always see your intentions, they can see your actions.</li>
<li>No matter how important the rush that you are in, there exists someone in a more important rush, possibly the person directly in front of you.</li>
<li>Find something small, cheap, and easily reproducible that makes your day better. Make it a point to include it in life as often as possible. I suggest tea.</li>
<li>Settle into the realization that other people can be as intelligent as you. And more intelligent. And less intelligent. But, understand that you often won&rsquo;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
<li>Ask your parents more questions about themselves, answer more of your parents' questions about yourself.</li>
<li>Unless you have finished writing a book, it&rsquo;s probably best not to tell anyone that you are writing a book.</li>
<li>Seeking comfort is just fine. Seeking unending comfort can be a trap; occasionally, pursue the uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Placing a ripe, soft avocado in a refrigerator will extend its life by two days, give or take.</li>
<li>Once in a while, when you feel strongly about it, break a rule.</li>
</ol>

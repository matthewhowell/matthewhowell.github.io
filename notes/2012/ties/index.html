    <p>When I was 12 years old, my father taught me to tie a four-in-hand knot. He gave me a hands-on lesson and a sheet of illustrated instructions from an old tie box. We disagreed on the ideal width of that knot, a preference which evidently increases with one&rsquo;s years, but we both understood the utility of it. It was simple. And it served a purpose.</p>

<p>We also understood that I was, from that moment on, the tier of my own ties.</p>

<p>That four-in-hand has accompanied me to interviews, to weddings, and to funerals. It&rsquo;s come with me to new cities and returned with me to old towns. It&rsquo;s shown up for important moments in my life and helped me show up, appropriately dressed, for important moments in the lives of people close to me. And sixteen years later, I am still recreating it, crudely, each morning before I before I go to work.</p>

<p>I write software for a living in a windowless basement. The dress code for which is not formal.</p>

<p>I have not found that women are unavoidably attracted to neckwear.</p>

<p>That tie gets to leave my closet every weekday, and gets to ride on a train or a bicycle, to serve as a reminder.</p>

<p>I spend a non-trivial amount of my time trying to improve and to update skills that I am lucky enough to be able to earn a living with. Those skills allow me to make things. They allow me to call home a city that I love. And they help me to define a curiosity which I feel grateful to know.</p>

<p>I aspire to that same effort in the parts of my life for which I am not paid. I want to be better in what I write, and in what I say, and in how I treat people. I have days when I am so aware of all of this that it&rsquo;s thick in the air the moment that I wake up. But, I have days when it&rsquo;s not. And it&rsquo;s useful to build a symbol of it into my routine.</p>

<p>That tie allows me to literally affix my aspirations to my neck with a knot. It is simple. And it serves a purpose. I put it on in the morning and it becomes a small, sometimes striped reminder that I am going to be a professional today, in everything that I do. And that I am on my own to tie the knot and to choose the width.</p>

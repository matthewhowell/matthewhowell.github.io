      <h1>On Collecting Music</h1>
      <time datetime="2022-01-01">January 1, 2022</time>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Last week, in the year 2022, I spent $AMOUNT to purchase a CD and have it mailed to my house. I did this on purpose and here I&rsquo;ll make an attempt to explain why.</p>
<p>This CD will soon find a home on a small white table, next to a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/pioneers-x-cm56-desktop-bluetooth-audio-system-goes-both-ways/">Pioneer CD player</a>, and a couple dozen other discs that comprise our family&rsquo;s music collection. Again, the year is 2022.</p>
<p>A brief bit of background, which certainly does not apply to everyone.</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a comfortable, privileged life that includes disposable time and income, with which I can to do things like consider collecting music.</li>
<li>I enjoy music. Or, I <em>find joy in music</em>. It&rsquo;s a small thing, not a large part of my life, but something that I&rsquo;m happy to spend time with and money on. Easier still if some of that money is directly supporting the people who are creating the music, and thus, creating that joy. Seems a fair transaction.</li>
<li>There are 4 humans living in our house, two very small ones.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-buy-a-physical-thing">Why Buy a Physical Thing?</h2>
<p>Purchasing a physical CD helps me accomplish three things.</p>
<h3 id="1-to-own-the-music">1. To Own the Music</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably obvious that none of us &ldquo;own&rdquo; the music that we stream on Spotify, Apple Music, or any other subscription music service. Cancel your subscription and watch the music evaporate from your phones and devices.</p>
<p>But, what&rsquo;s not always as obvious, is that we don&rsquo;t really own music that purchase digtally, either.</p>
<p>Purchasing and owning a digital good is precarious, at best. Often, as consumers, we make these purchases that would be accurately described as complex licensing agreements that can be ended, unilaterally, by the licenser. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Our shared understanding of <em>ownership</em> just doesn&rsquo;t often transfer honestly to digital goods. In the U.S., digital purchases are generally not thought to be covered under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">first-sale doctorine</a> (the idea that allows &ldquo;individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to others&rdquo;). Legally, I cannot sell you my used MP3s at a yard sale.</p>
<h3 id="2-to-support-the-artist">2. To Support the Artist</h3>
<p>Buying a physical copy of a record is an effective and straightforward way of supporting the artist.</p>
<p>There are not always simple ways to support creative work, but purchasing a phyiscal copy of a that work often tends to be one of the best. With direct economic support we can reward artists for making art that we love and encourage them to make something new.</p>
<p>Again, money for joy, a square trade.</p>
<p>Part of my eventual embrace of streaming music services was to stop viewing them as and inadequate replacement of the ways that I was already collecting music: they are not. They are a different tool, they are not a collection at all, but a timed ticket. Which is fine in its own way.</p>
<p>Music streaming is an incredibly useful way to sample an anrmous variety of music. But, it is not collection.</p>
<p>Why does collection matter?
1. Reliability
2. Physical relationship
3.</p>
<p>Streaming music subscriptions are wonderful for discovering music and for making that music portable and convenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;discovery format&rdquo;
This split makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I subscribe to Apple Music to discover new music with a capped cost. In theory, the algorithms and curated playlists help with that.</p>
<p>From there, the purchasing of music a &ldquo;next step&rdquo;. If I find myself want to live with a record, share it with my family, dedicate a small amount of shelf to it, then I&rsquo;ll buy a CD.</p>

When I buy a CD from Bandcamp I also get high quality digital downloads. If later, I lose the CD (or if it, say, breaks at the tiny, determined hand of an enthusiastic toddler) I can recreate it from those digital files pretty easily.</p>
<p>Sidenote, CDs were kind of a happy accident of capitalism
## History of CDs</p>
<pre><code>Happy accident of capitalism
    - Sony still great
    - Not yet a full on media company
    - Collaborates with Philips and releases format, so that they can make devices
    - Record labels just at a chance to offer high quality audio of back catalogs and new releases
    - Encryption? Why?
    - Sony, also a computer company
        - Years later after 1988 Yellow Book CD-ROM standard is released and CDs quickly became the goto large storage format for software
        - Which led to Orange Book, mixing of those formats
    - Consumer CD writable drives didn't become widely available until the late 1990s
    - Ubiquitous internet access
        - Napster launched in 1999
    - https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/consumer-cd-r-drive-priced-below-1000/
        
Eventual situation:
    - Cheap consumer product (CD drives) can pull lossless audio from cheap consumer music format CDs
    - Files could be backed up and shared, replacement discs
    - Cheap consumer blank media can write that back out, be played in millions of CD players (portable, cars, home stereos,)
    - This is amazing!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Books

&gt; The Yellow Book, published in 1988,[9] defines the specifications for CD-ROMs, standardized in 1989 as the ISO/IEC 10149 / ECMA-130 standard. 

&gt; For the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the Yellow Book CD-ROM standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data computer data storage medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.

<h3 id="3-to-collect-artifacts">3. To Collect Artifacts</h3>
<p>This is less of a priority, but owning a physical piece of music is a fun.</p>
<p>I can hold something in my hand that was produced by the person making the music, there&rsquo;s an undeniable power in this connection. Looking through the album art, lyrics or photo booklets, even the art on the disc itself.</p>
<p>And this is something that is easily shared with my children. They regard CDs with a bit of wonder that just isn&rsquo;t present when they&rsquo;re poking at buttons on a screen. They can understand physical objects better, too.</p>
<h2 id="and-why-not-vinyl">And Why Not Vinyl?</h2>
<p>The large, multicolored, resurgent elephant in the room at this point is: why not collect vinyl records?</p>
<p>A few years ago when I made the conscious decision to begin collecting CDs, I spent some time considering vinyl. In fact, I had all but decided on vinyl and then changed my mind. What follows here isn&rsquo;t an argument against vinyl, just my personal reasoning for choosing CDs.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am happy that vinyl is finding more popularity. Yay for collecting music and yay for having choices!</p>
<h3 id="vinyl-is-more-fragile-format">Vinyl is more fragile format</h3>
<p>Hoping to share the collecting with young children, this mattered a lot. Vinyl records require more care and more careful handling which just isn&rsquo;t possible explain to my 3-year-old son.</p>
<p>Vinyl can bend and warp</p>
<h3 id="cds-are-replacable">CDs are replacable</h3>
<h3 id="vinyl-is-more-expensive">Vinyl is more expensive</h3>
<p>New CDs can be had for $10 or $12 in most cases and used CDs are much cheaper still.</p>
<p>New viynl records seem to average around $20 or $25, but are often priced even higher.</p>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>Nearly all cars manufactured from the late 90s until about 2016 included CD players. Ebay is full of options. Sony still produces a simple $100 stereo CD player.</p>
<p>Record players are pricier and have consumable parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-cd-boombox-black/6430022.p?skuId=6430022">https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-cd-boombox-black/6430022.p?skuId=6430022</a></p>
<p>Stlyus lasts a year or two.</p>
<h3 id="more-consistent">More consistent</h3>
<p>Not necessarily better sound quality, which is subjective.</p>
<p>Read enough reviews of vinyl pressings online and find more than a few just seem to have been poorly made. CDs seem foolproof.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Equipment. Record players, as a general rule are more expensive. They also contain consumable items (needles) and have more moving parts (belt, arms). CD players are still easily had, mostly cheap, and sound nice. I can burn my own CDs (backup, replacements, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are other reasons, less objective</p>
<ul>
<li>CDs sound better (to me)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I envy the vinyl&rsquo;s expansive, beautiful album art.
- not as durable, degrades (clean, eventually wear)
- physically larger (takes up more space)
- quality not as reliable (depends on pressing and quality of kit)
- more expensive (at least 2x the price)
- but, gold standard of album art</p>
<p>For me, the ability to replace a lost or broken CD</p>
<p>Also, cassette tapes are back again. This strikes me as mostly a nostalgia. But, they are smaller and more portable than CDs.</p>
<p>My ideal music format, then, might be something like an oversized, ultra-durable SD card. A game cartridge-sized music thingy. Come with a beautiful, super oversized case that could deliver album art and other niceties.</p>

<h3 id="on-streaming-music">On Streaming Music</h3>
<p>Last week I read a review of a new record, released by a band that I had heard of, but had never listened to. The review was effusive enough that I decided that I would give it some time that night (while tidying up the kitchen).</p>
<p>I opened Apple Music on my phone, put on headphones, and proceeded to listen to most of the album before I removed my dish gloves.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Back to the $AMOUNT, though. After spending enough time with the album&rsquo;s 10 tracks to feel confident, I made the purchase. The artist is selling CDs on Bandcamp for $12, taxes and shipping push it closer to $17.</p>
<p>I enjoy casually listening to music</p>
<p>2020 was the first year that I&rsquo;ve ever paid for streaming music. Our family now shares an Apple Music subscription. And it&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;ll probably keep it.</p>
<p>The size of the catalog (for most purposes) is fine, the quality is fine, the reliability is fine.</p>
<p>For discovering new music, streaming services are an objective and significant improvement upon what we all had access to a decade ago.</p>
<p>There is a very real difference between the ways that we can spend money on music.</p>
<p>Streaming an artist&rsquo;s songs supports the artist in real, but very limited ways.</p>
<p>I will likely spend money on music, so how best to spend that money. I haven&rsquo;t attended a live concert in a few years. So, I will spend some extra money supporting artists.</p>
<p>Reasons to collect music rather than stream it.</p>
<p>I believe that there are good reasons to collect music, but this is not that argument.</p>
<p>My goals, which may not be anyone else&rsquo;s goals, for collecting music are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Support the artist</li>
<li>Create a durable music collection</li>
<li>Collect artifacts</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="supporting-musicians">Supporting Musicians</h2>
<p>Purchasing physical copies of music is the best way to support musicians.</p>
<h2 id="durable-access">Durable Access</h2>
<p>Purchasing physical copies of music and then downloading the high quality digital versions is the most reliably way to create a durable music collection.</p>
<h2 id="collecting-artifacts">Collecting Artifacts</h2>
<p>Purchasing CDs allows me to collect physical artifacts that I enjoy and can share with others.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why support the artist?</li>
</ol>
<p>If I enjoy an artist&rsquo;s work then it is in my interest to encourage that work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Durability
If Zune goes away
If I have access to high quality digital files then I can burn new copies CDs cheaply.
This is the main advantage that CD collecting has over vinyl. Vinyl records degrade with each play, the act of extracting the music from the plastic is inherently destructive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collecting artifacts is fun</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This
CD
Quality better than vinyl
Does not degrade with listens
Easy to digitize and store
Can be reproduced with quality media, cheaply</p>
<p>First, when I purchase a CD, I own the CD.</p>
<p>Next, when I find music that I like enough to go out of my way to support the artist, I want to do so in a straightforward way. Purchasing a physical good from an artist-friendly storefront (<a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, for example) is very straightforward</p>
<h2 id="bandcamp">Bandcamp</h2>
<p>When I purchase a $12 CD from Bandcamp, the artist receives something like $9 or $10 from that sale. A dollar or two goes to Bandcamp (which is just fine) and a little less to a credit card processor (less excited, but mostly unavoidable).</p>
<p>My $12 purchase actually ends up being more like $16 after taxes and shipping. So, what do I get for my $16?</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical CD, shipped to my door</li>
<li>A hosted (for as long as Bandcamp exists) high quality digital download</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The digital downloads are a very nice convenience as well. It saves me from needing to rip the CD myself. I can grab the downloads, toss them on a Plex server and a cloud storage backup. Lots of artists even offer lossless FLAC files.</p>
<p>If I stream an album on Apple Music or Spotify, what does the artist get?
For the artist to receive that $9, I would need to stream that 10,122</p>

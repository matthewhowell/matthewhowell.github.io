      <h1>On Collecting Music</h1>
      <time datetime="2022-01-04">January 4, 2022</time>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>Last week, I spent $11.72 to purchase a CD and have it mailed to my house. Here, I&rsquo;m writing down some thoughts on why I collect music and why, in 2022, I still buy CDs.</p>
<p>To start, three verifiable facts about myself.</p>
<ol>
<li>I enjoy music. I <em>find joy in music</em>.</li>
<li>I have small children, and I want to share music with them.</li>
<li>I have a comfortable, privileged life that includes a bit of disposable time and income, which I can use to do things like collect music and write about it.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ok-but-why-buy-music">Ok, but why <em>buy</em> music?</h2>
<p>Yes, we could stream it. Our family shares an Apple Music subscription, which is fine. But, purchasing a physical CD helps me accomplish three things that streaming music does not.</p>
<h3 id="1-to-support-the-artist">1. To Support the Artist</h3>
<p>Buying a physical copy of music is an effective and straightforward way to support a musician.</p>
<p>There are not always simple ways to support creative work, but buying it is usually a good bet. With direct economic support, we can reward artists for making the art that we love.</p>
<p>Money for joy, seems a fair transaction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tiny thoughts on streaming:</strong>
Streaming music subscriptions are wonderful for discovering music and for making it portable and convenient. I began to appreciate streaming music once I stopped viewing it as an alternative to collecting music, but as a complementary tool.</p>
<p>Stream first and widely, collect sparingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-to-own-the-music">2. To Own the Music</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably obvious that none of us &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the music that we stream from Spotify, Apple Music, or wherever else. Cancel that subscription and watch the music evaporate from your phones and devices.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not as obvious, is that we don&rsquo;t own the music that we <em>purchase</em> digitally, either.</p>
<p>Purchasing and owning a digital good is precarious, at best. Often, as consumers, we make these purchases that would be better described as complex licensing agreements that can be ended, unilaterally, by the licenser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples of poor behavior involving digital purchases:</strong>
Amazon can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-10-01-amazon-clarifies-kindle-book-deletion-policy-can-still-delete-b.html">remove books from &ldquo;your kindle,&quot;</a> Google Play Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december/">no longer allows downloads of &ldquo;your music,&quot;</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/you-dont-own-your-digital-movies/">you never really owned &ldquo;your movies&rdquo;</a> from Vudu. And all of these large companies <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00070056">routinely</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18292177/microsoft-ebooks-refund-stops-selling-digital-books-store">lose</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/microsoft-will-soon-shutter-its-music-store-and-streaming-service-move-users-to-spotify/">interest</a> in selling digital goods or supporting the ones they&rsquo;ve already sold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our shared understanding of <em>ownership</em> just doesn&rsquo;t transfer honestly to digital goods. In the U.S., digital purchases are not thought to be covered under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">first-sale doctrine</a>.</p>
<p>Owning a physical copy of music provides privileges that streaming does not. I can listen to a CD indefinitely, with no Internet connection, and without a monthly cost. I can make a copy of it. I can sell it. I can donate it. My children can inherit it, have a quick laugh, and then donate it themselves.</p>
<p>For certain records, I want more than conditional temporary access.</p>
<p><mark>For the records that bring me that joy, I want to live with them, find them space on our shelf, and share them with my family.</mark></p>
<h3 id="3-to-collect-artifacts">3. To Collect Artifacts</h3>
<p>Also, owning a physical piece of music is fun!</p>
<p>I can hold an object in my hand that was made by another person. There is an emotional heft to that connection.</p>
<p>I love the simple, tactical ritual of opening the digipak, removing the disc, placing it on the tray, watching it disappear into the machine, hearing the mechanical whirl of motor, and waiting for the laser to assemble the song from the landscape of the plastic and push it through the speakers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How CDs work, kind of:</strong>
CDs are made by encoding music into digital data and physically pressing that data into the disc. It&rsquo;s arranged in a single line that begins in the center of the disc and spirals out toward the edge.</p>
<p>To play the music back, the disc is rotated and those indentations (called <em>pits</em>) are read by a laser and a lens to reconstruct the original data. That data is then handed it off to a DAC (digital-to-analog converter), which converts it to an analogue waveform, which is sent to an amplifier, and out the speaker.</p>
<p>Music becomes data written onto a disc, the data is read back and becomes music.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc">Read a lot more at Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this physical experience is one that is easily shared with my children. They regard CDs with a bit of wonder and an interest that aren&rsquo;t present when they&rsquo;re poking at buttons on a screen. <mark>Humans understand physical objects.</mark></p>
<h2 id="why-not-vinyl">Why Not Vinyl?</h2>
<p>The large, round elephant in the room at this point is: why not collect vinyl records?</p>
<p>A few years ago when I decided to return to CDs, I did spend some time considering vinyl. Below is my personal reasoning for choosing CDs, not really an argument against vinyl. Regardless, I am happy that vinyl is finding more popularity in recent years. Yay for supporting artists, owning music, collecting artifacts, and having choices!</p>
<h3 id="1-vinyl-records-are-less-robust-than-cds">1. Vinyl records are less robust than CDs</h3>
<p>Vinyl records require more care and more careful handling, which just isn&rsquo;t possible to explain to my 3-year-old son. <a href="https://blog.discogs.com/en/how-to-store-vinyl-records/">Taking care of vinyl</a> doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good use of our energy.</p>
<h3 id="2-cds-are-user-replaceable">2. CDs are user replaceable</h3>
<p>If I break or lose a CD, I can produce a new, perfect copy of it in my own home, for very little money.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely beautiful accident of capitalism. CDs are a well-supported, high-quality digital media format that to manage retain a lot of the freedom of simpler analog formats. We were lucky to have this!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How CDs happened:</strong>
Sony and Philips jointly developed the format so that they could sell CD players. Record labels embraced CDs to monetize their back catalogs. Later, personal computers and cheap hardware allowed consumers to pull high quality music files from purchased discs and make copies and mixes.</p>
<p>In 2022, it&rsquo;s unlikely that a new physical music format will be developed. Even if it were, would we ever get another universal format supported by plentiful and cheap hardware, embraced by record labels, and endowed with as much freedom and utility as CDs?</p>
<p>More thoughts on this below.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-cds-are-cheaper-than-vinyl">3. CDs are cheaper than vinyl</h3>
<p>New CDs can be had for $10, $12, or maybe $14. Used CDs are much cheaper still. New vinyl records go for $20 or $25, and are often priced even higher.</p>
<h3 id="4-cd-production-is-more-reliable">4. CD production is more reliable</h3>
<p>Read enough reviews of vinyl records online and you will find more than a few complaints about the &ldquo;pressing.&rdquo; The <a href="https://www.yoursoundmatters.com/watch-out-for-these-faults-when-buying-new-vinyl-records/">vinyl manufacturing process seems prone to inconsistency</a> that isn&rsquo;t as common with CDs.</p>
<h3 id="5-cd-players-are-cheap-and-sound-great">5. CD players are cheap and sound great</h3>
<p>The CD player in our home was purchased a few years ago for less than the cost of a good Bluetooth speaker. It has AM and FM tuners, Bluetooth, analog input and output, and two very nice stereo speaker boxes made of real wood.</p>
<p>A comparable quality record player, with an amp, and a pair of bookshelf speakers would almost certainly cost quite a bit more. More still when factoring in the cost of an occasional stylus replacement.</p>
<h3 id="6-cds-are-smaller">6. CDs are smaller</h3>
<p>CDs take up less space on the shelf, and they&rsquo;re easier for young children to handle.</p>
<h3 id="but-a-few-selling-points-for-vinyl">But, a few selling points for vinyl</h3>
<ul>
<li>That big, beautiful, best-in-class album art</li>
<li>The undeniable romance of placing the record on the turntable and carefully dropping the arm</li>
<li>That warm, weathered sound profile that many people prefer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="also-maybe-cassettes">Also, maybe cassettes!</h2>
<p>Cassette tapes are also, oddly, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/entertainment/music/cassette-tape-revival-philadelphia-music-20210321.html">available again</a> from a lot of independent sellers, often as a limited run or special release. This strikes me as mostly nostalgia?</p>
<p>But, cassettes did have some nice characteristics. They are smaller and more portable than CDs. Mixtapes were really fun. And golly, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5861062/sony-walkman-at-35">that Sony Walkman was an iconic piece of design</a>.</p>
<h2 id="an-ideal-format">An Ideal Format</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to have CDs, and they fit my needs well, but they are surely not perfect. My ideal music format might be something like a large, ultra-durable SD card. An unbreakable, game cartridge-sized music whatsit that can be packaged alongside album art and other niceties.</p>
<p>A great, modern physical music format might have these attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lossless music encoding</li>
<li>Robust and durable</li>
<li>Small and portable</li>
<li>Unencrypted and accessible data</li>
<li>Easy to copy, reproduce, and make your own</li>
<li>Attractive and beautiful as an object</li>
<li>No reliance on the Internet or a cloud service</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait. Am I just describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc">Sony MiniDisc</a>? Maybe I&rsquo;m sad that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/15/3989872/status-symbols-sony-minidisc">MiniDisc never found its market</a>. Yes, I am sad about that.</p>
<p>There are some folks working on things like this, but nothing that I found looks very promising.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://access.trackrhino.com/make-music-physical-again">TrackRhino</a> is a small NFC music card, but it&rsquo;s linked to a cloud service.</li>
<li><a href="http://usbmusiccards.com">USB Music Cards</a> (which really need a better name) look OK, but they&rsquo;re selling an analytics product along with it. &ldquo;Know when (day, month, year) and where (City, State, Country) your fans are listening to your music.&rdquo; Yuck and no, thank you.</li>
<li>There are some neat DIY projects using a Raspberry Pi and an NFC reader. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/who-needs-vinyl-records-when-youve-got-raspberry-pi-and-nfc/">This one</a> looks nice. But, a DIY solution isn&rsquo;t accessible to very many people.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for the forseable future, collecting music means CDs on our shelf.</p>

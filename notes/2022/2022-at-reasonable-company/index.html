	<p><a href="https://www.reasonable.work">Reasonable Company</a> was formed in January of 2022. At the end of each calendar year, I will take time to revisit the company's goals, reflect on its successes and failures, and define my expectations for the next 12 months.</p>
<h2 id="defining-reasonable-company">Defining Reasonable Company</h2>
<p>First, each year, I want to revisit the company's purpose and definition. In 2022, I wrote: <em>Reasonable Company is the values-led design and creative practice of Matthew Howell.</em></p>
<p>Ok. This is still both aspirational and accurate, so onward to the next year.</p>
<h2 id="goals-from-2022">Goals from 2022</h2>
<p>I wrote down eight goals for 2022, completing five, detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="1-create-the-company">1. Create the company</h3>
<p>Complete. Reasonable Company LLC was formed in January.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company is in good standing and financially viable for 2023.</li>
<li>The company acquired everything that it needs at the moment (bank account, credit, payment processing, domain name, email, hosting, etc).</li>
<li>The company brand and logo marks were designed and finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-launch-the-company-website">2. Launch the company website</h3>
<p>Complete. <a href="https://www.reasonable.work">reasonable.work</a> was launched in February. It's a small static website, generated by Zola, and hosted on Netlify.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://shop.reasonable.work">shop.reasonable.work</a> was launched using Big Cartel to sell art prints</li>
<li>A Ko-fi page was set up to explore sponsorship and other revenue</li>
<li>Plausible Analytics was used for while, but ultimately abandoned for lack of need</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-release-one-open-source-project">3. Release one open-source project</h3>
<p>Complete. <a href="https://reasonable.work/colors/">Reasonable Colors</a>, an open-source color system for building accessible, nice-looking color palettes, was released in April. However modest, this was the most successful and prominent open-source project that I've ever built.</p>
<p>The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/matthewhowell/reasonable-colors">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/matthewhowell/reasonable-colors">GitLab</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4-find-one-open-source-project-sponsor">4. Find one open-source project sponsor</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>This didn't happen and after some initial thought, I decided against pursuing it. Until I have more time to dedicate to maintenance and can feel confident about responding to issues and pull requests, I don't think sponsorship makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="5-release-one-piece-of-art">5. Release one piece of art</h3>
<p>Complete. <a href="https://reasonable.work/1024-lemons/">1024 Lemons</a> was released in May.</p>
<h3 id="6-sell-one-art-print">6. Sell one art print</h3>
<p>Complete. As of today, Reasonable Company has sold 3, physical 1024 Lemons art prints to customers (and one digital lemon, which was generously purchased by my partner).</p>
<p>I will mark this as the company's biggest success to date. Not to overstate the situation, but selling a piece of art is the fulfillment of a long-held creative dream.</p>
<h3 id="7-release-one-video-game">7. Release one video game</h3>
<p>No. </p>
<p>But, also, kind of. I did not release a video game this year. I did finish a small video game, but it was a gift and not released publicly or sold.</p>
<h3 id="8-sell-one-video-game-copy">8. Sell one video game copy</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No game released, so no game to sell.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-2023">Goals for 2023</h2>
<p>In 2023, Reasonable Company hopes to continue making things and slowly growing itself into a machine capable of making more things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Release five pieces of art</li>
<li>Sell five art prints</li>
<li>Release two open-source projects</li>
<li>Release one video game</li>
<li>Sell one video game copy</li>
<li>Release one video game soundtrack</li>
<li>Sell one video game soundtrack copy</li>
<li>Release one book</li>
</ol>

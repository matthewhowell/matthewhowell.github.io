    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>Hello from <strike>Delaware</strike> <strike>Philadelphia</strike> <strike>New York City</strike> <strike>Bangkok</strike> <strike>Minnesota</strike> Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Who/What:</span> My name is Matthew Howell and you are reading the <em>About</em> page of <a href="https://www.matthewhowell.net">my personal website</a>, on the Internet. I am a computer programmer and–<em>sometimes</em>–other kind of person.</p>

<p>Since 2005, it&rsquo;s been my great privilege to work on and around the web. That work has most often been some flavor of software development, but it has occasionally pushed into design and teaching.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Where:</span> I spent my entire childhood in Delaware, my formative adulthood in New York City, and now I probably live in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">What else:</span> Some other interests that have found non-trivial places in my life include tea, public libraries, public transportation, cameras, walking, gardens, trees, language, physical books, small video games, and pizza.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Why:</span> Why does this website exist? You can read its <a title="Purpose" href="/purpose">official stated purpose</a>, but mostly just because making websites is fun, so why not?</p>

<p><em>Exhale</em> and lets all agree that that sure seems like enough information for everyone.</p>

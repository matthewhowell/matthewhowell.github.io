    <p>A charred piece of wood, cracked and decomposing, sat for months in a slowly rusting fire pit on a concrete slab in a small back yard. It sat there through summer heat and rainstorms. It sat there through the cooler fall days and into this winter.</p>
<p>This small, square fire pit collected the water from those summer storms. It collected leaves, dropped from an oak tree in a neighbor&rsquo;s yard, branches outstretched over a wooden fence. The leaves dried and broke.</p>
<p>It collected the season&rsquo;s first snow on an overcast day in December. That snow melted in the low, warm sun a few days later. Its water dripped though the metal mesh, blending without complaint into the cold pool below.</p>
<p>That water, the leaves, and the charred piece of wood remained, undisturbed, until a sunny day just before the new year. And when the heavy, screen lid was removed from that small fire pit, it revealed a soft, damp, thick carpet of unexpectedly bright green moss.</p>
<p>The piece of wood and the moss now sit, without complaint, in a window box attached a small shed in that small yard. The only of bit green in an already long, grey winter.</p>
